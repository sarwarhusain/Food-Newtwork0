        <p>Itâ€™s super simple: cherry tomatoes are tossed with olive oil and placed in a baking dish
          with a block of
          feta. Everything gets baked up until the tomatoes burst, releasing their sweet and jammy flavors. The feta
          gets melty and oozy. You mix it all up into a quick sauce, toss in minced garlic, basil, crushed red pepper,
          and pasta. Boom, dinner is done!</p>

        <p>Have you ever had Hainanese chicken rice before? Are you as obsessed with it as I am? Iâ€™m
          guessing the answer
          is no because I have a lifelong, deep obsession with chicken rice.</p>

        <p>People are calling it an affront to food and Italians are turning over in their graves. I
          especially like the meme where someone is literally just *screaming.*

          But why? I mean, honeycomb pasta is rigatoni stacked up in a springform pan, topped with sauce and cheese and
          baked up into a pie. You could say that itâ€™s kind of like a lasagna but with rigatoni. Or mini upright
          manicotti or cannelloni.</p>
